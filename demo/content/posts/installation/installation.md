> **Important**: Before diving right into the installation check the [Using a Gatsby Theme](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/themes/using-a-gatsby-theme) guide!

1. Install the theme via npm or yarn:

```bash
npm i @nehalist/gatsby-theme-nehalem --save
# or
yarn add @nehalist/gatsby-theme-nehalem
```

2. Add the theme theme to your `gatsby-config.js`:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  plugins: [`@nehalist/gatsby-theme-nehalem`],
};
```

3. Be sure to have a `content` directory within your Gatsby installation __and__ a `tags.yml` file within this directory!

For further instructions check the other docs:

- [How to create posts and pages](creating-content)
- [How to customize the theme](/customization)
- [How to create custom pages](/custom-pages)

Or check the [features](/features) to get an idea of all the possibilities with Nehalem!

I hope you enjoy this theme!
